# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.1.4] - 2026-03-06

### Changed

- Hardened helper process execution by using absolute binary paths for `/usr/bin/log` and `/bin/date` to prevent `PATH` hijacking in runtime, explain, and generate flows
- Hardened default and cache profile persistence with symlink rejection plus atomic write-and-rename behavior
- `run --explain` now preserves the child process exit code even if postmortem explanation collection fails (best-effort warning only)
- Terminal output now sanitizes control characters from violation-derived text before printing
- `allow_domains` is now fail-closed in v1: lint emits an error and `check`/`run` reject profiles that set it

## [0.1.3] - 2026-03-06

### Changed

- `run`/external command flows now auto-bootstrap a global default profile at `~/.config/seatbelt/profile.yaml` (via `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`) when no profile is found; generated profile extends `ai-agent-networked`
- Preset inheritance (`extends`) now resolves transitively and detects cycles with explicit errors
- Violation collection now matches modern macOS Sandbox log formats and filters by PID post-parse for both streaming and post-run queries
- Generated SBPL now escapes all user-derived string literals safely (`subpath`, `literal`, `regex`, `global-name`) to prevent malformed policy output
- `generate` observation mode now validates PID/log-query execution paths and reports log command failures explicitly

## [0.1.2] - 2026-03-06

### Changed

- Homebrew publish now emits `Formula/seatbelt.rb` (install path `kulesh/tap/seatbelt`) instead of `seatbelt-bin.rb`
- `seatbelt-bin` package now inherits workspace homepage metadata for Homebrew formula generation
- Added installation and maintainer release setup docs for the Homebrew tap flow

## [0.1.0] - 2026-03-04

### Added

- **`seatbelt run`** — run a command under a sandbox defined by a YAML profile or built-in preset
- **`seatbelt compile`** — compile a YAML profile to raw SBPL for use with `sandbox-exec`
- **`seatbelt check`** — lint and validate a profile file with six rules covering version, network, filesystem, exec, and naming
- **`seatbelt explain`** — parse sandbox violations from system log or file and explain them in plain English with YAML fix suggestions
- **`seatbelt generate`** — observe a process under a report-all sandbox and emit a minimal profile from its access patterns
- **`--verbose` flag** on `run` — stream violations to stderr in real time
- **`--explain` flag** on `run` — print per-violation explanations after the process exits
- **`--strict` flag** on `check` — treat warnings as errors
- **`--base-preset` flag** on `generate` — subtract already-covered rules from the generated profile
- Six built-in presets: `ai-agent-strict`, `ai-agent-networked`, `ai-agent-permissive`, `read-only`, `build-tool`, `network-only`
- YAML profile format with magic variables (`(cwd)`, `(home)`, `(tmpdir)`, `~`), glob patterns, and preset inheritance via `extends`
- Profile discovery chain: `./seatbelt.yaml`, `./.seatbelt.yaml`, `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/seatbelt/profile.yaml`
- External subcommand passthrough (`seatbelt -- npm test` auto-discovers default profile)
